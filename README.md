# Water-Potability-Analysis---Ensemeble-and-Boosting

Water Potability Analysis and Prediction

This project is focused on analyzing and predicting water potability using various machine learning techniques. It employs a comprehensive range of Python libraries to preprocess data, visualize insights, and construct predictive models. The primary dataset used in this analysis contains multiple parameters that contribute to determining water's potability.

Key Features of the Project:

1. Data Preprocessing: Utilizes libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn's SimpleImputer for handling missing values, ensuring the dataset is clean and suitable for analysis.
2. Visualization: Employs Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for detailed visualizations, providing insights into the distribution and correlation of the data features.
3. Predictive Modeling: Features a variety of machine learning models from Scikit-learn and XGBoost, ranging from logistic regression to more complex models like gradient boosting classifiers. Each model is evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting water potability.
4. Model Evaluation: Includes cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess each model's performance rigorously.
5. Optimization: Implements GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, enhancing model performance.

Primary Components:

1. Data Exploration: Initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure, missing values, and statistical summaries.
2. Feature Engineering: Techniques to handle missing data, scaling, and normalization to improve model input.
3. Model Training and Evaluation: Training different models, evaluating their performance, and selecting the best-performing model.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing models to achieve better accuracy.
5. Insights and Conclusion: Drawing conclusions from model predictions and identifying key factors affecting water potability
